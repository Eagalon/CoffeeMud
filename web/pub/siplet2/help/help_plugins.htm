<DIV ID="HELPROOT">
<h3>Plugins</h3>
An <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugin')">Plugin</a> is a collection of
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Timers')">Timers</a>, 
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Aliases')">Aliases,</a>,
<a href="javascript:menuHelp('Triggers')">Triggers</a>,
and a special javascript Script that can receive and respond to special
events.  A plugin is represented as a large JSON document.
<P>
Like other editors, you can add or remove global plugins from the 
Global Options/Plugins menu, or plugins that apply only 
to the active mud window's phonebook entry through the Window/Plugins menu.
<P>
The top list field in the Plugin editor allows you to either load a new
plugin from your local filesystem, paste one into the text area, or delete an existing 
one from the list.  Consult the <a href="javascript:menuHelp('Plugin')">Plugin</a>
help for the proper syntax of the add plugin text area.
<P>
When entering a plugin definition by hand, the text area will turn red and stay red
until the document meets minimal requirements, or if it has any errors.  When the 
textarea is red, you can hover over the little ? help button to the left of it to
see the specific problem, or click on the help button to pull up the full help file.
