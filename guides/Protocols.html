      <p>The
CoffeeMud Server, like all other MUD servers in its class, is
responsible for much of the player view. &nbsp;To accomplish this, the
server utilizes several protocols that assist a variety of MUD game
clients in presenting this view. &nbsp;This document exists to
enumerate and detail those protocols, with special emphasis on any
particular CoffeeMud specific additions or changes.</p><h2><a name="ascii">ASCII</a></h2>
      <p>All
text from the MUD server is transmitted as per the ISO-8859-1 encoding,
an 8-bit superset of US-ASCII, though only the specified characters
shown below are typically used.&nbsp; This encoding can be changed from
the coffeemud.ini file.&nbsp; The End-of-line marker follows the Diku
standard of LF-CR (\n\r, or 10-13).&nbsp; Most text files, however, can
be encoded using either, or any combination of \n and \r, so long as
the same standard is used throughout the file.</p>

<p /><h2><a name="ascii">ANSI</a></h2>
      <p>The ANSI escape
sequences are an ASCII-compatible protocol for varying both the display
of text, and for controlling cursor position and other terminal
features.&nbsp; For our purposes, it is best to think of it as what
allows 16 foreground colors for text, and 8 text background
colors.&nbsp; None of the other rich features of ANSI escape codes are
presently sent by the server.&nbsp; If or when they do, this section
will be updated.<br />
</p>
      <p>An escape code begins with the sending of ASCII code 27 'ESC',
followed by ASCII 91 '[', followed by one integer, or two integers
separated by semicolons, and finally ending with ASCII 109 'm'.</p>
      <p>The escape codes that the server may be expected to send include:</p>

<p /><h2><a name="ansi256">ANSI-256</a></h2>
      <p>This is a
further extension of the color capabilities of ANSI that provides 256
foreground and background colors.&nbsp;&nbsp; While&nbsp; ANSI&nbsp; is
supported by basically any and all clients, ANSI-256 tends to be less
supported.&nbsp; This can lead to undefined behavior when one of the
special colors are sent by the server.&nbsp; For this reason, this
feature can be specifically turned off by the user using the CONFIG
command.</p>
      <p>The format for ANSI-256 is as follows:</p>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">\033[38;5;XXm&nbsp; FOREGROUND COLOR XX (0 - 255)<br /></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">\033[48;5;XXm&nbsp; BACKGROUND COLOR XX (0 - 255)<br /></span><br />
<p /><h2><a name="telnet" /> TELNET</h2>
      <p>TELNET is a system
of inline escape codes that CoffeeMud uses to negotiate client
capabilities between the client and server, and to support the other
protocols below.&nbsp; It is defined by RFC-854, which is available on
the internet for your inspection.</p>
      <p>TELNET negotiations consist of a set of asynchronous
message/response pairs.&nbsp; Typical of this would be the server
sending to the client a WILL -feature- or WONT -feature- message, and
the client responding with either a DO -feature- or DONT -feature.</p>
      <p>These negotations are of the form:</p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace;">[IAC][DO][CODE]</p>
      <p>Where [IAC] is decimal 252, [DO] is either 253 for DO, 254 for DONT, 251 for WILL, or 252 for WONT. [CODE] is one of the TELNET feature codes (see below)</p>
      <p>Another type of TELNET negotation is the SUB-OPTION
negotation, which allows the client to send more information to the
server than can be represented in a single byte.&nbsp;&nbsp; The format
of these is:</p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace;">[IAC][SB][CODE][STREAM][IAC][SE]</p>
      <p>Where [IAC] is decinal 252, [SB] is 250, [SE] is 240, [CODE]
is a Sub-Option code (see below), and [STREAM] is one or more bytes
specific to the SUB-OPTION code.&nbsp; <br />
      </p>
      <p>The set of features that the server will automatically negotiate with the client upon connection includes the following:</p>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">[IAC][DO][TERMTYPE]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Offer to support the

      <span style="font-family: monospace;"><br />
      </span><span style="font-family: monospace;" />The client will
then be given a period of time to respond with the appropriate DO or
DONT before the server just proceeds with its default behavior.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
The "Terminal Type" negotiation is expected to be responded to by the client with:<br />
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">[IAC][SB][TERMTYPE][ZERO][CLIENT NAME][IAC][SE]</span><br />
Where [IAC], [SB], [TERMTYPE], and [SE] are as above.&nbsp; [ZERO] is
decimal 0.&nbsp; [CLIENT NAME] is an ascii stream of the name of the
client. <br />
      <br />
The NAWS negotiation is expected to be responded to by the client with:<br />
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">[IAC][SB][NAWS][WIDTHLB][WIDTHHB][HEIGHTLB][HEIGHTHB][IAC][SE]</span><br />
Where [IAC], [SB], [NAWS], and [SE] are as above.&nbsp; [WIDTHLB] and
[WIDTHHB] are the low and high byte of the terminal width.&nbsp;
[HEIGHTLB] and [HEIGHTHB] are the low and high byte of the terminal height (which is unused).<br />
      <br />
Other features that may be enabled or modified by clients include:<br />
      <br />
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Go-Ahead/Suppress Go-Ahead:</span><br />
      <p>Go-Ahead is a code sent by the server that informs the client that
the it is now waiting for input.&nbsp; Very few clients support
this, and the number that don't outweigh those that do, so, while this
feature can be enabled, it is not by default.&nbsp; The format of this is
simple: [IAC][GA] where [GA] is decimal 249. The client may also send
[IAC][DO][SGA] to suppress the go-ahead feature, where [SGA] is decimal
3.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Echo</p>
      <p>If enabled, this will cause the server to echo back to the
client all the characters sent from it.&nbsp; While it can be
negotiated in the normal way mentioned above, it is more typical to be
automatically set by the server in reaction to a Terminal Type
response.&nbsp; For example, if the client says that it is "ZMUD", then
echo is automatically disabled, regardless of what the client may have
sent previous to that.&nbsp; The [ECHO] code is decimal 1.<br />
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Logout</p>
      <p>Upon receiving a DO [LOGOUT] code from the client, the server
will disconnect the client and close its socket.&nbsp; [LOGOUT] is
decimal 18.<br />
      </p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Are you There?</span><br />
      <br />
Upon receiving [IAC][AYT], the server will respond with a space and \b.&nbsp; The [AYT] code is 246.<br />
      <br />
<p /><h2><a name="mccp" /> MCCP</h2>
      <p>The Mud Client
Compression Protocol, when enabled, alters the encoding sent by the
server to the client to one that is GZIP compressed ASCII.&nbsp; There
were two versions of this protocol, and CoffeeMud supports version 2.</p>
      <p>The protocol is enabled during the early connection
period.&nbsp; The server will send the TELNET code WILL
COMPRESS2.&nbsp; If the client responds with DO COMPRESS2, then the
server will wait 750ms and send the TELNET sub-negotiation code 86,
after which all output from the server to that client will be in the
GZIP compressed format.&nbsp; No data will be sent, however, for
another few seconds to give the client time to process the response and
set up.&nbsp; See also the above section on the TELNET protocol for
more information on how negotiations are done.</p>
      <p><br />
      </p>
      <h2><a name="mcp"> MCP</a></h2>

      
      <p>The MUD Client Protocol is an entirely in-line system for
invoking 'packages' or programs on the server by the client, or on the
client by the server.&nbsp; CoffeeMud supports, by default, only two
packages:&nbsp; one that negotiates the MCP features, and a client-side
full screen editor package.&nbsp; Complete details on MCP can be found
at <a href="https://www.moo.mud.org/mcp/mcp2.html">https://www.moo.mud.org/mcp/mcp2.html</a><br />
      </p>
      <p>Upon connection to the server, the client will be sent a mcp protocol announcement string:</p>
      <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#mcp version: 2.1 to: 2.1</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>If the client does not support MCP, then that's the end of
it.&nbsp; However, if it does support MCP, it will begin sending
supported packages information to the server, starting with the
following special command:<br />
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: monospace;">#$#mcp authentication-key: [AUTH-KEY]</p>
      <p>The [AUTH-KEY] sent is then saved by the server to confirm against other inline MCP messages.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The MCP protocol general command format is as follows:<br />

      <br />

      <span style="font-family: monospace;" /><span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#[MCP-PACKAGE] [AUTH-KEY] [KEY]: [VALUE] ... etc ..</span><br />

      </p>
      <p>[MCP-PACKAGE] would be one of the package names, usually
beginning
with MCP.&nbsp; After the following space, the auth-key and another
space,
followed by an optional set of key:value pairs.&nbsp; Keys may not
contain
whitespace.&nbsp; After the colon must be a whitespace character
followed by
a double-quoted value, or a value also without whitespace.&nbsp; The
value
may then be followed by whitespace and more key:value pairs.&nbsp; If a
string beginning with #$# must be sent to the client by the mud for
consumption by the user, then the line should begin with #$"#$#...</p>
      <p>Multi-line commands begin in the following format:</p>
      <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#[MCP-PACKAGE] </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">[AUTH-KEY] </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">... etc ... [KEY]*: [VALUE] _data-tag: [TAG-VALUE]</span><br />



      </p>
      <p>As you can see, if the last real key on the ends with the '*'
character and the line ends with a a key called "_data-tag" whose value
is a hex number, then it denotes the beginning of a multi-line
command.&nbsp; In this case, the following line would begin with #$#*
followed by data-tag value the to continue the previous line, and ends
when a line that starts with #$#: is encountered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are
some examples:<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#* </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">[TAG-VALUE] </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">[KEY]: [VALUE] </span><span style="font-family: monospace;" /><span style="font-family: monospace;">... etc ... </span><br />
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#: </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">[</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">TAG-VALUE</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">] </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">[KEY]: [VALUE] </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">... etc ... </span></p>

      <p>Anyway, back to the negotiation.&nbsp; After receiving the
authentication-key, the server will immediately respond with a series
of messages announcing which packages it supports:</p>
 
      <p style="font-family: monospace;">#$#mcp-negotiate-can [AUTH-KEY] package: dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit min-version: 1.0 max-version: 1.0<br />
#$#mcp-negotiate-can [AUTH-KEY] package: mcp-negotiate min-version: 1.0 max-version: 2.0<br />
#$#mcp-negotiate-end<br />
      </p>
      <p>This will be followed (or preceded?) by the client sending a similar set of messages declaring the packages that it supports.</p>
Packages supported:<br />
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit-content</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>This package is sent by the server to the client asking it to
open up a screen text editor with the given content.&nbsp; Once the
client user is done editing the file, the package is invoked by the
client to send back the changed text.</p>
      <p>The command sent by the server will look like:</p>
      <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit-content [AUTH-KEY] reference: #64.name name: Data type: string content*: "" _data-tag: [NUMBER]</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#* [NUMBER] content: "[FIRST LINE OF THE FILE]"</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">...</span><br style="font-family: monospace;" />
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">#$#: [NUMBER]</span></p>
      <p>* If a developer wants to add more Server-side MCP packages,
they should be written as Java files that implement the
com.planet_ink.coffee_mud.Libraries.interfaces.ProtocolLibrary.MCPPackage
interface, and placed in the
com/planet_ink/coffee_mud/Libraries/mcppkgs/ directory before boot.</p>

<p /><h2><a name="msp">MSP</a></h2>
      <p>The MUD Sound Protocol
allows sound files to be played by the client.&nbsp; It can also
specify a URL to download the sound file from a web server supported by
the MUD.&nbsp; A detailed definition of the protocol can be found at <a href="https://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/msp.htm">https://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/msp.htm</a><br />
</p>
      <p>Before the server will begin to send MSP inline commands, it
will first negotiate client support for the protocol.&nbsp; It does
this using a TELNET WILL MCP escape code, as described above in the
TELNET section.</p>
      <p>Once the server is aware of client support, then, at
appropriate times, it will send the MSP inline command, which is as
follows:</p>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">!!SOUND([FILENAME] V=50 P=25 U=http://webserver.domain/sounds/)</span><br />
      <br />
To add new sounds to CoffeeMud, you should put them as a loose wav file
in /resources/web/pub/sounds/ , and also put them in the sounds.zip
file found in the same directory, for people who want to install all
the sounds in their client at once.<br />
      <br />
<p /><h2><a name="mxp">MXP</a></h2>
      <p>The Mud eXtension
Protocol, developed by ZuggSoft, is an HTML-like markup language that
provides quite a few client view capabilities that can be driven by the
server, but also configured by the client user.&nbsp; These features
include sounds, images, context menus, text markup, color, frames,
cursor control, and entities.A detailed definition of the protocol can be found at  <a href="https://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/msp.htm">https://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/mxp.htm</a></p>
      <p>Before the server will begin to send MXP tags, it will
first negotiate client support for the protocol.&nbsp; It does this using a
TELNET WILL MXP escape code, as described above in the TELNET section.</p>
      <p>Once the server is aware of client support, it will
automatically transmit the file /resources/text/mxp.txt to the client,
which contains numerous entity definitions for context menus,&nbsp;
health bar tags, and the &lt;SUPPORT tag to notify the client of the
MXP features that the client supports.&nbsp; These include: IMAGE,
SEND, GUAGE, FONT, B, IMAGE, and SOUND.</p>
      <p>Tags are so similar to HTML as to not really be worth
elaboration, but I will anyway.&nbsp; An example would be:
&lt;HITPOINTS&gt;24&lt;/HITPOINTS&gt;, after, for example, definiting
an MXP entity with &lt;!ELEMENT HITPOINTS '&lt;FONT COLOR=GREEN&gt;'
&gt;&nbsp; This would result in the number 24 being seen as green on
the muds client, or whatever else is sent inside &lt;HITPOINTS&gt;
tag.&nbsp; <br />
      </p>
      <p>Tthe <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;!ELEMENT</span> tag
is unique to MXP, and is used to give definition to substitute some tag
(such as HITPOINTS with others, such as FONT.&nbsp; It can also be used
to call out or define some value. &nbsp; &lt;!ELEMENT is followed by
the name of the tag being defined, followed by the word EMPTY and the
FLAG attribute, or a replacement MXP string in single quotes ''.&nbsp; <br />
      </p>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">GUAGE</span> tag is for
adding a column to the "health bar" type feature.&nbsp; The tag begins
with &lt;GUAGE [TAG] Max=[MAXTAG] ... , where [TAG] is the name of the
tag whose value will update this bar, where [MAXTAG] is the name of the
tag whose value updates the maximum value of this bar.&nbsp; Other
attributes include COLOR, and CAPTION.</p>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">IMAGE</span> tag is for
sending images to the client.&nbsp; The format is &lt;IMAGE [FILENAME]
URL="http://your.web.site/images/' H=[HEIGHT] W=[WIDTH]&gt;.&nbsp;
Stock images are typically found in the /web/pub/images/mxp/
directory.&nbsp; Images may be added there, and then associated with
objects of various kinds for automatic association by the mud by
editing the file /resources/mxp_images.ini and adding a new line or
editing an existing line.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">SOUND</span> tag is for
sending sounds to the client.&nbsp; The format is &lt;SOUND FILENAME
V=50 P=25 U=http://your.web.site/sounds&gt;.&nbsp; This is remarkably
similar to the MSP format above, which was probably intentional.
:)&nbsp; See the MSP section for more information on CoffeeMud Sounds.</p>
      <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEND</span> tag is for
creating right-mouse-click context menus on various lines of text to
allow the user to enter commands that make sure of them without
typing.&nbsp; The format is &lt;SEND HREF="[COMMANDS]"
HINT="[TEXT]"&gt;&nbsp; The [COMMANDS] are a pipe-delimited list of MUD
commands that are entered when a menu option is chosen.&nbsp; The
[TEXT] is a pipe-delimited list of the menu options corresponding to
the commands.&nbsp; The string &amp;text; is used to substitute the
value inside the &lt;SEND tag.&nbsp; <br />
      </p>

      <p>To differentiate MXP tags from normal uses of the less-than
&lt; sign, you will often see a carrot ^&lt; preceding the less-than
sign, to let the mud know that an MXP tag was embedded in an outgoing
string.&nbsp; <br />

<p /><h2><a name="atcp">ATCP</a></h2>
      <p>ATCP is the predecessor
to the GMCP protocol, and is superceded by it.&nbsp; CoffeeMud will
recognize and accept TELNET negotiation of this protocol, but does not
use it.</p>
      <p><br />
      </p>
<p /><h2><a name="msdp">MSDP</a></h2>
      <p>The MUD Server Data
Protocol is a protocol that embeds itself completely in TELNET
sub-option negotiation codes in order to send and receive data and data
requests to and from the server and client.&nbsp; It is entirely about
getting extra unseen information from the server.&nbsp; You can find
details for this protocol at the following site: <a href="https://tintin.mudhalla.net/protocols/msdp/">https://tintin.mudhalla.net/protocols/msdp/</a><br />
